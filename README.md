# Child_Support_Table_Extractor
This python script will extract the child support table from the Washington State Child support schedule and save it as JSON to a file with the same name.json.
I'm considering addding support for other states:
  1. https://justice.oregon.gov/child-support/pdf/guidelines_scale.pdf
  2.
